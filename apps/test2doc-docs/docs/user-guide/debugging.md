title: Debugging Failing Doc Generation

Sometimes your tests might be passing, but failing when generating documentation. Here are some tips to help debug what is happening.

## Disabling exit on failure

To prevent doc generation from becoming corrupted, the default behavior is to exit the process if a test fails.

To disable this behavior you can set the `IGNORE_TEST_FAILURES` environment variable by adding `IGNORE_TEST_FAILURES=true` to your script command.

```json title="package.json" {6}
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "test": "playwright test --ui",
    "doc": "TEST2DOC=true playwright test --config=playwright-test2doc.config.ts",
    "doc:debug": "IGNORE_TEST_FAILURES=true TEST2DOC=true playwright test --config=playwright-test2doc.config.ts"
  },
```

## Run with Playwright UI

Adding the `--ui` flag to the script or passing it in on the command line will start up the Playwright test suite with the UI. This will allow for more information and a visual inspection of what the problem might be.

### Passing the flag from the command line

```sh
pnpm doc:debug --ui
```

### Adding the flag in the script commands

```json title="package.json" {6}
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "test": "playwright test --ui",
    "doc": "TEST2DOC=true playwright test --config=playwright-test2doc.config.ts",
    "doc:debug": "IGNORE_TEST_FAILURES=true TEST2DOC=true playwright test --config=playwright-test2doc.config.ts --ui"
  },
```

## Flaky tests

If a test is flaky (passes when running the test normally but fails often during doc generation), the most pragmatic solution is unfortunately to skip the test for doc generation and create a manual doc to capture that functionality.

To skip a test you can use Playwright's tagging feature and filter out the test by tags. See the [Filtering Tests guide](../getting-started/filtering-tests.md) for more details.

This should only be a temporary solution, as you should probably still investigate the root cause for the flakiness and resolve it.
